**My Accenture Placement Experience – A Journey of Hope and Confidence**

Hey friends! 😊
If you're aiming for Accenture – go for it! It’s truly one of the most desirable companies, and here's how the selection process worked during my campus placement:

### ✨ Selection Process:

1. **Aptitude Test**
2. **Group Discussion (GD)**
3. **HR Interview**
4. **Final (Technical/HR) Interview**

---

### 📝 **Aptitude Test:**

* The test was quite manageable.
* **Topics included**: General English (articles, prepositions), Venn diagrams, two comprehension passages (one easy, one moderate), and **essay writing**.
* **Essay Topic**: *“If I were the Prime Minister of India”* – only 5 minutes were given, and a minimum of 100 words was required. So, be quick and concise!

Out of 1000 students, about 400 cleared this round.

---

### 💬 **Group Discussion (GD):**

* Our group had 15 members, only **4 were selected**, so it's clearly an **elimination round**.
* Topics included:

  * *Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi*
  * *Should cold drinks be banned?*
  * *Should capital punishment be there or not?*

**Tips:**

* If you have a strong point, **initiate the GD** – it reflects leadership.
* If you can’t start, **wait and make one solid, relevant point** clearly and audibly.
* If the GD becomes chaotic, try to calm others while making a meaningful point – it shows maturity and control.

### 👥 **Interviews (HR & Technical):**

Both interviews were conducted simultaneously for many students. Some appeared first for HR, others for technical. For me, both rounds were a **mix of HR and technical questions**.

#### **HR Questions:**

* Tell us about yourself.
* Why Accenture?
* What can you bring to the company?
* Are you open to relocation (e.g., to Chennai)?

#### **Technical Questions (CSE background):**

* What is inheritance? Give an example.
* Write a program on inheritance (even simple answers are fine).
* What are data structures?
* Define variable, linked list.
* Since I had done Oracle 9i:

  * What is an index?
  * What is an inner join?
  * Write two SQL queries (one with a join).

> **Tip**: Confidence matters more than perfect answers. Even if unsure, attempt confidently.

For others:

* Questions were based on **favorite subjects** (12th or college).
* Some examples:

  * Physics: Faraday’s or Newton’s Laws
  * Chemistry: e.g., `Ca + H₂SO₄ = ?`
  * Electronics: Draw microprocessor diagram

### ✅ **Final Selection:**

Out of 1000 students, **only 50 were finally selected**.
Yes – **I made it!** 🎉

---

### 🙏 **My Takeaway:**

I had previously been rejected by **Tech Mahindra** in the final HR round. It was disheartening at the time, but I now realize:

> "**Whatever happens, happens for the best.**"

Accenture gave me the opportunity I had been hoping for. I’m deeply grateful to **Freshersworld.com** for its resources and practice papers.

### 💡 **Final Advice:**

* Stay **confident**
* Work on your **communication skills**
* Revise your **core subjects**
* Keep **faith in yourself and in God**

**You’ve got this. All the best!** 💪🌟
**Never lose hope. Your time will come.** 🙌
